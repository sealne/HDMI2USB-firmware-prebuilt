If you would like this RAM to be implemented in block RAM, please select a larger device or increase the value specified by the BRAM_Utilization_Ratio constraint.
INFO:Xst:3212 - HDL ADVISOR - Asynchronous or synchronous initialization of the register <ethmac_reader_counter> prevents it from being combined with the RAM <Mram_mem_grain3_1> for implementation as read-only block RAM.

   This is not a recommended design practice in Spartan-6 due to limitations in
   the global routing that may cause excessive delay, skew or unroutable
   situations.  It is recommended to only use a BUFG resource to drive clock
   loads. Please pay extra attention to the timing and routing of this path to
   ensure the design goals are met. This is normally an ERROR but the
   CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE constraint was applied on COMP.PIN
   <hdmi_out_pix_bufg_1.O> allowing your design to continue. This constraint
   disables all clock placer rules related to the specified COMP.PIN.
WARNING:Place:1137 - This design is not guaranteed to be routable! This design
   contains a global buffer instance, <hdmi_out_pix_bufg>, driving the net,
   <hdmi_out0_pix_clk>, that is driving the following (first 30) non-clock load
   pins.

* Net Skew is the difference between the minimum and maximum routing
only delays for the net. Note this is different from Clock Skew which
is reported in TRCE timing report. Clock Skew is the difference between
the minimum and maximum path delays which includes logic delays.

* The fanout is the number of component pins not the individual BEL loads,
for example SLICE loads not FF loads.

Timing Score: 0 (Setup: 0, Hold: 0, Component Switching Limit: 0)

Number of Timing Constraints that were not applied: 16

Asterisk (*) preceding a constraint indicates it was not met.
   This may be due to a setup or hold violation.
